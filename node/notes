1. create package.json - npm init
    "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
        "start": "node app.js",
        "start-server": "node app.js"
    },

    start is a reserved work so we can execute it as npm start
    where as start-server is not a reserve keywork so we need to execite it as npm run start-server 
2. npm install nodemon --save-dev
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.2"
  },
    nodemon is a 3rd party lib used for restart of server when we make changes and save.
    --save-dev tell that it is a dev only dependency and updates package.json with a devdependency entry
    -g can be used if we want to install it globally
    NOTE : ^ infront of package version in package.json symbolises if npm install is run then install the package dependencies and update them to latest version if exists.

3. npm install --save express
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
